## Prerequisites  
 - **Proficiency:** Beginner | Intermediate | Advanced
 - **Tutorials:** [Create SAP HANA Vora, developer edition, in the cloud](http://go.sap.com/developer/tutorials/vora-setup-cloud.html)

## Next Steps
 - Interactive data analytics on SAP HANA Vora using Apache Zeppelin (coming soon)
 - Select a tutorial from the [Tutorial Navigator](http://go.sap.com/developer/tutorial-navigator.html) or the [Tutorial Catalog](http://go.sap.com/developer/tutorials.html)

## Details
### You will learn  
You will learn how to connect to your SAP HANA Vora instance to manage it. There are two main ways you will perform administration tasks:
 - using Apache Ambari, which provides an easy-to-use web UI to manage and monitor Apache Hadoop clusters and components, including SAP HANA Vora software,
 - logging to OS of the host using `ssh` secure protocol and running commands there.

### Time to Complete
**15 Min**.

---

1. If your instance is in the `Suspended` status, then use SAP Cloud Appliance Library (CAL) to **Activate** it.

    Use the CAL interface to set how long the instance should run, before the CAL suspends it. This way the CAL helps you to prevent the instance, when you finished using it, but forgot to suspend manually.

2. To open Apache Ambari web UI click on **Connect** in your SAP HANA Vora instance in CAL, and then pick **Open** a link for `Application: Ambari`.

    The port of Ambari web UI has been preconfigured for you in the SAP HANA Vora, developer edition, solution in CAL. As well its post has been opened as one of the default **Access Points**.

3. Log into Ambari web UI using the user `admin` and the master password you defined during the instance creation in CAL.

4. In the example below you can see that (1) all services, including SAP HANA Vora components, are running, that (2) there are no issues with resources, and that (3) there are no alerts generated by the the system.

    You use this interface to start/stop the cluster components if needed during operation or troubleshooting.

    >Please refer to Apache Ambari official documentation if you need additional information and training to use it.

    >For detailed review of all SAP HANA Vora components and their purpose please review [SAP HANA Vora help](http://help.sap.com/hana_vora_re)

5. To connect to the instance's OS using ssh client you will need the key-pair `.pem` file, which you downloaded when created the SAP HANA Vora instance in CAL.

    In Unix-like systems (including Mac OS) you run this command in terminal window:
    ```
    ssh -i [vorakey].pem [IPaddress] -l ec2-user
    ```
    where `[vorakey].pem` is the name of your key-pair file, and `[IPaddress]` is the IP address of your instance.

    In Windows you can use the ssh client, like PuTTY. In case of PuTTY you need to convert `.pem` file to PuTTY's own format `.ppk`. Use **PuTTY Key Generator** application to import the `.pem` file and to save private `.ppk` key.

    Next open a new session in PuTTY and provide:
    - IP Address of the instance in **Host name** under `Session`
    - Select newly generated `.ppk` file in **Private key file for authentication** under `Connection -> SSH -> Auth`
    - Provide user `ec2-user` as **Auto-login username** under `Connection -> Data`

     Click `Open` to login to the host's OS.

6. Once you are logged you can switch to `root` user if needed, using a command
    ```
    sudo su -
    ```

    There is as well the user `vora`, which is an owner of sample files, preloaded into HDFS and used later on for exercises.

    You can switch to `vora` user either from `root` user, or from other users using master password.
