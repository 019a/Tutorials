[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 1: ](Create new folder)]Now you are ready to create our calculation views. From the `db/src` folder, right click and choose **New**, then **Folder**.  
![New Folder](8.png)
Enter the name of the folder as "models" and click **OK**.  
![Name the folder](9.png)
[DONE][ACCORDION-END][ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 2: ](Create a new calculation view)]In the models sub-folder of your project, create a new calculation view based upon the expanded information for the products. This will require joining the products, texts, `businessPartner`, and address tables.Right mouse click on the models package, choose New -> Calculation View
![SHINE](10.png)
Enter the name as PRODUCTS and a Label of Products View.Choose DIMENSION as the data category.  A DIMENSON Calculation View will be very similar to the older Attribute View â€“ A basic join with no aggregation.Click **Create**.
![SHINE](11.png)
[DONE][ACCORDION-END][ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 10: ](Create a join node)]You want to join several tables from our project.  Ultimately you will join `MD.Products`, `MD.BusinessPartner`, `MD.Addresses` and `Util.Texts` (twice).In order to do so we have to create a join node for each join criteria.Start by creating a Join Node pressing the **Create Join** button.
![SHINE](12.png)


As we have several joins to add drag this new join node down near the bottom of the design window.

Click on the node and rename it to `Product_BP`.

![SHINE](14.png)


Press the Plus button next to the node to add `tables/views` to the join node.

![SHINE](15.png)


Add `MD.Products` to the node.

![SHINE](16.png)


Repeat the process and add `MD.BusinessPartner` to the node.

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 13: ](Join two tables)]

We now want to create a join between the two tables on the `SUPPLIER.PARTNERID` to the `PARTNERID` column. Drag and drop to connect the two columns in the Join Definition.

![SHINE](18.png)

Switch to the Mapping tab. We can then select which columns we want from this part of the join.
```Select PRODUCTID, TYPECODE, CATEGORY, CURRENCY, PRICE, NAMEID, DESCID, PARTNERID, COMPANYNAME,and ADDRESES.ADDRESSID and then choose Add To Output.```
![SHINE](19.png)


Optionally, you can change the name of a column as it becomes part of the view.  For example you might change CATEGORY to `ProductCategory`.

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 16: ](Add another join node)]

Repeat the process of adding a Join Node. Name this new Join Node Address and connect the output `Product_BP` to this new join node.

![SHINE](21.png)
![SHINE](22.png)

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 17: ](Add table to join node)]

Add the `MD.Addresses` table to this join node.

![SHINE](23.png)

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 18: ](Create another join)]

Create a join between the `ADDRESSES_ADDRESSID` of the previous join node output and the `ADDRESSID` column of the `MD.Addresses` table.

![SHINE](24.png)

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 19: ](Add columns)]

Repeat the process of adding columns to the output. Select all columns from the `Product_BP` node except `ADDRESSES_ADDRESSID`. From The `MD.Addresses` table select  CITY, POSTALCODE, STREET, BUILDING, COUNTRY, and REGION.

![SHINE](25.png)

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 20: ](Create another join node)]

Repeat the process of adding a Join Node. Name this new Join Node `Product_Name` and connect the output Address to this new join node.

![SHINE](26.png)

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 21: ](Add table to join)]

Add the `Util.Texts` table to this join node.

![SHINE](27.png)

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 22: ](Create another join)]

Create a join between the `NAMEID` of the previous join node output and the `TEXTID` column of the `Util.Texts` table.

![SHINE](28.png)

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 23: ](Change join properties)]

In the Join Properties window, change the Join Type to Text Join and the Language Column to LANGUAGE.

![SHINE](29.png)

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 24: ](Add columns)]

Repeat the process of adding columns to the output via the mapping tab. Select all columns from the Address node except `NAMEID`. From the `Util.Texts` table select TEXT but change the name of the TEXT column in the output to `ProductName`.

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 25: ](Add join node)]

![SHINE](31.png)

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 26: ](Add table to join node)]

Add the `Util.Texts` table to this join node.

![SHINE](32.png)

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 27: ](Create another join)]

Create a join between the `DESCID` of the previous join node output and the `TEXTID` column of the `Util.Texts` table.

![SHINE](33.png)

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 28: ](Chain join properties)]

In the Join Properties window, change the Join Type to Text Join and the Language Column to LANGUAGE.

![SHINE](34.png)

Repeat the process of adding columns to the output via the mapping tab. Select all columns from the `Product_Name` node except `DESCID`. From the `Util.Texts` table select TEXT but change the name of the TEXT column in the output to `ProductDesc` .

![SHINE](35.png)

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 29: ](Connect the output of the Product_Desc node)]

Connect the output of the `Product_Desc` node to the Projection node at the top of the design window.

![SHINE](36.png)

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 30: ](Auto Map by Name)]

In the Projection node and Mapping tab, press the **Auto Map by Name** button.

![SHINE](37.png)

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 31: ](Select the Key column for PRODUCTID)]

Select the Semantics node and choose the Columns tab. Select the Key column for PRODUCTID.

![SHINE](38.png)

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 32: ](Change the Apply Privileges value)]

In the View Properties tab, change the Apply Privileges to the blank value.

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 34: ](Build module)]

Build the `hdb` module and then return to the HRTT tool. Your container will now have an entry in the Column Views folder for this new Calculation View.

![SHINE](41.png)

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 35: ](Test the output)]

For an initial test make sure your output looks similar to the following:
