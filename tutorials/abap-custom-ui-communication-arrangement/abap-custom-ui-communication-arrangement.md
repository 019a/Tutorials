## Prerequisites  
The assignment of the Business Catalog **`SAP_CORE_BC_COM`** to your user and **`Create OAuth Communication System & User`** as tutorial represents the Prerequisites for the usage of Communication Arrangement.

## Next Steps
 (coming soon).

### You will learn  
You will learn how to enable SAP Cloud Platform Development with the Web IDE against a specific S/4HANA System via OAuth authentication. First a Communication Arrangement for Web IDE Scenario `SAP_COM_0013` in S/4HANA will expose essential services, that Web IDE needs. Then SAP Cloud Platform Subaccount will get a destination which holds data for the connection and OAuth communication with the S/4HANA system. At the end you will see in Web IDE a list of Services that you can theoretically build extensions on.

### Time to Complete
