[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Enable Guaranteed delivery](&nbsp;)]

This is done in the custom transporter module. SAP documentation regarding the process can be found in section [Enabling Guaranteed Delivery for an Input Transporter](https://help.sap.com/doc/saphelp_esp_51sp10_adapt/5.1.10/en-US/e7/924c076f0f10149b76975e225dfdf7/frameset.htm).


[ACCORDION-END]
[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Implement Schema Discovery](&nbsp;)]

**a.** Add the following two commands to your `.cnxml` file:
```html

<Internal id="x_unixCmdDisc"
  label="Discovery Command"
  type="string"
  default="&quot;$STREAMING_HOME/adapters/framework/bin/discover.sh&quot;
  &quot;$STREAMING_HOME/adapters/framework/instances/mqtt_input/adapter_config.xml&quot;"/>
<Internal id="x_winCmdDisc"
  label="Discovery Command"
  type="string"
  default="&quot;%STREAMING_HOME%/adapters/framework/bin/discover.bat&quot;
  &quot;%STREAMING_HOME%/adapters/framework/instances/mqtt_input/adapter_con fig.xml&quot;"/>

```

**b.** Implement sampling or non-sampling schema discovery in your custom transporter module. Consult section [Implementing Schema Discovery in a Custom Adapter](https://help.sap.com/doc/saphelp_esp_51sp11_bca/5.1.11/en-US/e7/8a48b56f0f10149134ab152de88342/frameset.htm) for more details.

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Create an Output Adapter](&nbsp;)]

If you have followed this tutorial to create an input adapter, only minor changes will have to be applied to convert it into an output adapter.

**a.** `EspConnector`

  - **i.** You will need to choose either [`EspSubscriber`](https://help.sap.com/viewer/b5a4b8b1574f48a383f7a1e42e63d4d9/1.0.12/en-US/e789cecb6f0f1014bdc7ccdcbde12dd6.html?q=espsubscriber) or [`EspMultiStreamSubscriber`](https://help.sap.com/doc/saphelp_esp_51sp11_bca/5.1.11/en-US/e7/855da66f0f1014a43ad7ab965faf16/frameset.htm) instead of the `EspPublisher` we have used.

  - **ii.** To make this change, edit the `<Module type="espconnector">` element of your `.cnxml` file. Specifically, specify the chosen `EspSubscriber` in the `<InstanceName>` element

**b.** `Formatter module`

The convert(`AdapterRow in`) method will need to be edited to convert Streaming Analytics objects to `Strings`. You can change it to something along the lines of the following:

```java
Object obj = in.getData(0);
in.setData(0, obj.toString());
return in;
```

**c.** `Transporter module`

Instead of the following in execute():

```java
AdapterRow row = utility.createRow(msg);
utility.sendRow(row);
```

You will need something along the lines of the following:

```java
AepRecord record = (AepRecord)row.getData(0);
if(record != null) {
    String value = record.getValues().toString();
    myDataSink.send(value);
}
```

Where `myDataSink` is the object you are outputting your data to.

**d.** `Mqtt_input.cnxml`

  - **i.** Particularly the type attribute for the Adapter element should be changed to **"output"**

```html

<Adapter type="output" â€¦>

```

  - **ii.** You may consider `find > replace all` from input to output. This will require changing the `mqtt_input` folder name in **`%STREAMING_HOME%/adapters/framework/instances/mqtt_input`**

  - **iii.** Consider changing the name of this file to `mqtt_output.cnxml`

**e.** `Adapter_config.xml`, `modulesdefine.xml`, `parametersdefine.xsd`

You may consider changing "Input" to "Output" in names

  - **i.** `<MQTTInputTransporterParameters>`

  - **ii.** `<Name>MQTT Input</Name>`

**f.** `Mqtt.ccl`

This project assumes the adapter is an input adapter, you will need to make a new project. However, doing so is outside the scope of this tutorial.

[ACCORDION-END]
[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Create Stream Based Transporter and Formatter Modules](&nbsp;)]

**a.** Transporter

Change Execute() function according to following:

  - **i.** For input stream based transporters:

      - **a.** Create a `ByteBuffer` object and load data into it by calling `<ByteBuffer>.put<Type>(data)`

      - **b.** Call `utility.sendRowsBuffer()`

  - **ii.** For output stream based transporters:

      - **a.** Call `utility.getRowsBuffer()` which will return a `ByteBuffer` object.

      - **b.** Call `ByteBuffer.get<Type>()` to get data from the object.

Full `ByteBuffer` documentation can be found at [`ByteBuffer`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/ByteBuffer.html)

Documentation regarding custom `Transporter` modules can be found in section [Building a Custom Transporter Module](https://help.sap.com/viewer/a29f649d1a0d4b3f88c634250e42af77/5.1.12/en-US/e789b1b56f0f1014a969ccf833602144.html).

**b.** Formatter

  - **i.** Have your custom formatter class extend `com.sybase.esp.adapter.framework.module.StreamingFormatter`

  - **ii.** Implement the following functions:

    - **a.** The `init()` function.

        Prepare your formatter module to convert between data formats; for example, obtain properties from the adapter configuration file and perform any required initialization tasks.

    - **b.** The `start()` function.

        Perform any necessary tasks when the adapter is started.

    - **c.** The `execute()` function.

        Here is an example of the execute() function for a formatter that converts row-based data into stream-based:

        ```java

        public void execute() throws Exception {
          OutputStream output = utility.getOutputStream();  while(!utility.isStopRequested())  {
            AdapterRow row = utility.getRow();
            if(row != null) {
              AepRecord record = (AepRecord)row.getData(0);
              String str = record.getValues().toString() + "\n";   output.write(str.getBytes());
            }
          }
        }

        ```

    - **d.** For a formatter that converts from stream-based data into row-based, use:

        - **i.** `utility.getInputStream()` to obtain the `InputStream`

        - **ii.** `utility.createRow()` to create the `AdapterRow` objects

        - **iii.** `utility.sendRow()` to send the rows to the next module specified in the adapter configuration file

    - **e.** The `stop()` function

      Perform any necessary tasks when the adapter is stopped.

    - **f.** The `destroy()` function.

      Perform clean-up actions for your formatter.


Documentation regarding custom Formatter modules can be found in section [Building a Custom Formatter Module](https://help.sap.com/viewer/b5a4b8b1574f48a383f7a1e42e63d4d9/2.0.00/en-US/e789b6606f0f10149915c3cb6a302153.html?q=custom%20formatter%20module).

See the `$STREAMING_HOME/adapters/framework/examples/src` directory for source code for sample modules

[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Pre-Defined Transporter and Formatter Modules](&nbsp;)]

If your transporter or formatter modules don't require very complex implementation, they may already be provided with your Streaming Analytics installation.

You can find a listing of the predefined Formatter modules in section [Formatters Currently Available from SAP](https://help.sap.com/viewer/8280db55429040f8b665db30cf05a88e/2.0.02/en-US/e785c5536f0f10148ce5edaa93952636.html) as well as their location.

[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Start and Stop an Adapter in Standalone Mode](&nbsp;)]

  **a.** Comment out the `ATTACH INPUT ADAPTER` statement in the `ccl` code provided in the Appendix of this tutorial. The `ccl` should simply be as follows:

```sql

CREATE INPUT WINDOW InputWindow1 SCHEMA (
  Message string ) PRIMARY KEY ( Message ) KEEP ALL ROWS ;

```

  **b.** Uncomment the `<ProjectName>` and `<StreamName>` elements in `<EspPublisherParameters>`

  **c.** Start the project in Studio by pressing the deploy button.

  ![Deploy Streaming Project](deploy-project.png)

  **d.** Start the adapter by running `start.sh` and pass it the full path to your `adapter_config.xml`.

    `%STREAMING_HOME%\adapters\framework\bin\start.bat`
    `%STREAMING_HOME%\adapters\framework\instances\mqtt_input\adapter_config.xml`

  **e.** The adapter will use the `<EspProject>` element properties set in your `adapter_config.xml` file to connect to the project in studio and will use the `<MQTTInputTransporterParameters>` element properties as arguments.

[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Debug a Custom Adapter](&nbsp;)]

There are two main ways to debug custom adapters:

  **a.** The first is to use the `Eclipse` debugger. Steps for accomplishing this are outlined in this documentation. This debugger can be used to set break points and/or step through code.

  **b** The second is to simply use print statements.

  - **i.** For adapter run using the `ATTACH` statement

    - Use `utility.getAdapterLogger().info(String)` in your custom `Transporter` and `Formatter` modules to log information.

    - Streaming Analytics log info can be found using HANA Studio.

        - **a.** In the `SAP HANA Administration Console` perspective, double click your `SYSTEM` in the Systems panel

        - **b.** Navigate to the `Diagnosis Files` tab.

        - **c.** Look for a `.out` file corresponding to the project you are working on. You can open the file for read in HANA Studio by double clicking it.

    - `utility.getAdapterLogger().info()` will log messages to `<working-directory>\ projects\default.mqtt.0\logs\adapterframework.log.`

  **c** For standalone adapter run without the `ATTACH` statement

  - **i.** `utility.getAdapterLogger().info()` can also be used

  - **ii.** `utility.getAdapterLogger().info()` will log messages to the console in which the adapter start command was issued as well as `%STREAMING_HOME%/adapters/framework/bin/frameworkadapter.log`

  - **iii.** `System.out.println()` messages will also appear in the console.
