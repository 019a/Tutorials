SAP is not committing to resolving any issues that may arise from running HXE on these platforms.

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 1: ](Running the install)]
You have finally got to the most important and exciting part! Go into your home directory or wherever you have extracted the installation files into.

>IMPORTANT: As this process should not be interrupted, use a separate SSH client that handles connection intermittence, instead of the web client.

Log into the SSH client. Become `root` and go to the directory where you extracted the installation packages. You will now execute the installation script:

```
sudo su â€“
cd /tmp
./setup_hxe.sh
```

The script will prompt for different parameters:

- Installer root directory

This is the directory where the files have been extracted, plus `HANA_EXPRESS_20`, for example `/tmp/HANA_EXPRESS_20`.

Paste this value and press **Enter**.

- Components you want to install
Choose `all` to include XS Advanced tools (provided you have uploaded them) or `server` for the server-only installation:

- In this example, `ubuntu-hxe-server`:

- System ID:
The system ID you want to use. As you will probably use the tutorials on the many things you can do in HANA Express Edition, you may want to use `HXE` as proposed:
![Hostname](5.png)

- Enter Instance Number:
 The firewall rules have been created for instance `00`, so please update them accordingly if you choose a different instance number. Also, bear this in mind as the usual instance number used in tutorials is also `00`.

 - Master Password:
 This will be the password for administrator users such as SYSTEM or <SID>ADM.  You will definitely need to remember this password.

 > If you are installing the Applications package, this password is also used for the `XSA_ADMIN`, `XSA_DEV`, and `XSA_SHINE` users.

 Hit **Enter**. 

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]


[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 3: ](Let the installation begin)]

Review the Installation summary and hit *Y*. 

After you hit **Enter** the script will verbosely inform what it is doing. **Avoid disconnecting the terminal or interrupting the execution.**

Wait until the command prompt in the console is available for input again.

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 4: ](Check the installation)]

Once the installation finishes, you can scroll up and see if there are any visible errors in the console log.

You can also check the log by running command `ls -ltr` in the directory
`/var/tmp` and open the latest installation log file using commands such as `more <name of the file>` or `cat <name of the file>`. 

Finally, the command-line Lifecycle Management program can check the installation for you: `/hana/shared/HXE/hdblcm/hdblcm`.

>Hint: You can start the database again with command `./HDB start` and check if the services are running with `./HDB info`

> Remember: SAP HANA Express Edition license is free up to 32 GB of RAM.


[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 5: ](Set the host name)]

Remember to set you hosts file in your local computer with the pair <<external IP>>  <<host name>>. You will generally fins these files in folders `/etc/hosts` or in `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc`, and the configuration would look like the following example:

```
207.154.xxx.xxx	ubuntu-hxe-server
```

Where the  `207.154.XXX.XXX` stands for the external IP and the `ubuntu-hxe-server` value stands for the name of the host that you have set up in the server.


[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]
